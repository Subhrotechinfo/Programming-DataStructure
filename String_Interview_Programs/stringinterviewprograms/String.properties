#STRING:

#    1. matches() : 
#            It is used to check if the whole "text only" matches a pattern. 
#    2. compile() : 
#            Used to create a pattern object by compiling a given string that may contain
#            regular  expression.
#            
#            PATTERN FLAGS:
#

#                       or representation which must all boil down to a single

#java.util.regex.Matcher class:
#
#            1. find()  : mainly used for searching multiple occurences of a regular expression.
#            2. start() : used for getting start index of a match.
#            3. end()   : used for getting end index of a match, that is being found. 
#                         It returns index of character next to last matching character.
