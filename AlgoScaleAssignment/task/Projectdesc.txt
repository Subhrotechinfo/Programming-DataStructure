PROJECT NAME : 

ALGOSCALE

Each company(stock) is assigned a ticker value which is basically a word of four five letter and is similar to its short form.

 

This project basically contains two main parts.


1. Stocks


2. Portfolio

1. LossGainGraph Table


2. GeneralNumber 

Table


PAGES : 



1. Stocks : In Stocks we basically visualise the values of a stock and the probability of Loss/Gain in form of a chart. The charts are formed based on the data of LossGainGraph Table. In this page we can only visualise the chart of one ticker(one stock) at a time. The Table which is formed below is made by the data based on GeneralNumber Table.


TOOLS :
